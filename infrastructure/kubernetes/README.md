## Kubernetes Config folder

In this directory is all information necessary for the deployment of a K8s cluster.
Currently there is only the Ansible playbook role for installing and starting the nodes.

OBS: This is currently only working with a vagrant enviroment, mode config should be done for it to be deployable.
